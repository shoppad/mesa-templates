## Setup
- [Create a connected app in Slack](https://api.slack.com/apps/new).
- Enable **Incoming Webhooks** from the settings page.
- Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**.
- Select a channel that the app will post to and click Authorize. 
- Click **Copy** near your Webhook URL and paste the value as a Secret, with the key as "slack-webhook-url."
- Save the slack channel name you wish to use (for example "#unfulfilled-orders") as a Storage Item, with the key as `slack-channel.`
- Enable the Automation in the right sidebar and click **Save**.

## Optional Configuration
Changing the date range for unfulfilled orders
- By default, orders that are 7 days or older will be sent to Slack if unfulfilled. 
- To change this, find **Orders Virtual Output** under Outputs.
- Under **Advanced**, change the parameters to when you woud like the orders to be checked for fulfillment.
- For example, to check for orders that are more than 3 days old, but no older than 1 month, type `limit=-1&created_at_min={{"now" | date: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" | subtract_time: 30, "days" | date: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"}},created_at_max={{"now" | date: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z" | subtract_time: 3, "days" | date: "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z"}}`. Further information on proper date syntax can be found under [Virtual Outputs](https://docs.getmesa.com/article/597-outputs#output4).

## Slack message formatting
- Under Scripts you'll find the file `out-send-slack-notification.js`. By default this script will send a [richly formatted Slack notification](https://api.slack.com/docs/message-formatting#message_formatting) with buttons and text formatting. 
- If you prefer a simple Slack message, you can click on the **out-send-slack-notifications.js** file. Comment out the code in the block "BEGIN Comprehensive Slack request" and uncomment the code under "BEGIN Simple slack request (uncomment code below to enable)".
